Installed by Veterans. #### From Our Founder A mission born from service, built on trust. #### Ask for a FREE Energy Audit #### From Our Founder A mission born from service, built on trust. Tampa Bay Solar began as more than just a business idea-it was a calling. After serving over two decades as a Navy SEAL, I witnessed firsthand the critical importance of reliable and sustainable power sources in challenging environments. I learned the value of resilience, self-reliance, and the power of a strong, dependable team. Those lessons stuck with me, and when I transitioned back to civilian life, I knew I wanted to build something that mattered-not just for me, but for the people around me. I founded Tampa Bay Solar with a simple belief: everyone deserves access to clean, reliable energy without the noise or nonsense. Florida has sunshine in abundance-why not use it to empower families, cut energy costs, and do something good for the planet while we're at it? When you work with us, you're not getting a faceless corporation. You're getting a team that cares deeply about doing the job right. Many of us are veterans. We know what it means to show up, keep our word, and follow through-every time. We treat every home as if it were our own, and every customer as a neighbor, because they usually are. I'll be honest-this work is personal to me. Helping people break free from rising energy bills and giving them control over their power is deeply rewarding. Liberating individuals and families from a lifetime of electric bills, is not just a passion of mine, it's a core belief. We should all be free to create more in our lives with our given talents - solar helps us do just this. I still get excited every time we flip the switch on a new system and see the look on a homeowner's face when they realize what's possible. ### Successful Installs This isn't just about solar panels. It's about service, trust, and building a better future-one roof at a time. Thank you for taking the time to get to know us. We'd be honored to earn your trust.

Lasting relationships. ``` EXCELLENT Based on 349 reviews Ari Straus 2025-04-16 Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. A few years ago, Tampa Bay Solar installed 4 Tesla Powerwall batteries, roof solar, a solar pool pump, and solar hot water heater. Using sun-power only, we circulate pool water - driven by a solar pump - through the solar panels for additional efficiency, and it heats the pool water all season to enjoy the pool at 80+ degrees in the winter months. Water is boiling hot, and we used the backup electric auxiliary heater once in 3 years during 2 weeks of cloudy days. Most months, our electric bill is $25 - the minimum for the TECO meter to push excess power to the grid. After last year's hurricanes, our island in South Tampa lost power and gas for several days, we hosted several families for a few weeks during repairs since we were one of the few homes with power and hot water (and most gas-powered generators could not be used.) In mid-summer, we produce a bit more power than our Tesla system could manage, and Tampa Bay Solar sent out technicians to install an update to Tesla's package to accommodate our peak months. - and did so without us even asking or realizing that we were losing some Teco "credit" during peak months. We now plan to use Tampa Bay Solar from some new projects along the Treasure Coast in Port St Lucie. There is no better solar vendor. NFR Z 2025-04-10 Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. Fanez , Jhiems, Josue, Luis, and Alejandro did an amazing job! From day one when I signed the contract till the installation each step was well communicated. I would recommend Tampa solar to my friends and family. Puja Korabathina 2025-04-03 Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. Had a great experience. Very professional installation Jeordan Legon 2025-04-02 Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. Sharon, Daniel and Josh came to my rescue after my home was destroyed by the hurricanes. The solar company that installed my system said they only do new installations. They couldn't help me to salvage my solar panels so I could tear down ny damaged home and build a new one. Tampa Bay Solar stepped in and helped me to remove the solar panels. Grateful to the Tampa Bay Solar team for helping me out of a difficult situation. Bobbie Fox 2025-03-27 Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. Josh and his team just finished the removal of our solar panels. They were professional, polite, efficient and respectful of our property. I now feel confident that the replacement of our panels will go smoothly. Thank you Josh! Jolokia Bhut 2025-03-16 Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. I purchased my first small solar system from Tampa Bay Solar in 2019 to offset our electrical costs, halving our monthly bill. As both kwh and non-kwh based rates continued to increase, it became apparent we needed a larger system. Just as I was in the planning stage for this addition, we were without power for 5 days as a result of Hurricane Milton. This made a whole-house system logical for the upgrade. It was a big project to incorporate an existing system into a new whole-house solution, but Tampa Bay Solar made it happen with minimum downtime and problems. Special thanks to the entire TBS crew and especially the on-site supervisor, Fanez who went above and beyond to make the transition as seamless as possible. I highly recommend Tampa Bay Solar for your solar needs, and request Fanez to run your job! James de Vore Pete Radigan 2025-03-12 Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. We had Tampa. Bay Solar out to take down our solar for a roof replacement. The crew included James, Josh, Daniel and Fino. The were fantastic and went above and beyond for customer service. Highly recommend this company for all your solar needs. Verified by Trustindex Trustindex verified badge is the Universal Symbol of Trust.
