## Adele

Business - Tokyo - Durham University

"For me like so many others COVID has resulted in a lot of uncertainty, especially over the next academic year. Consequently it became increasingly difficult to find motivation, however just one week with my company has given me a motivation boost, not only to resume studying, but also to start planning for the future. Although we may not see it yet, there is an endpoint."

## Kelsey

Business Development - Barcelona - University of Oregon

"Overall I've really loved my time here. My Program Coordinators were so amazing and helpful to me. I definitely think we had a str ong sense of community in the tribe because I genuinely feel close to everyone. I feel so much more independent now and feel like I really am capable of doing things I was previously scared of."

## Tegan

Pharmaceutical Science - Barcelona - Monash University

"Coming from a niche science background I never considered the work to be able to be done remotely, let alone with a company 8 hours behind my time zone. Thankfully, I was placed with a company that really matched my field of interest where I was able to apply my university knowledge to the workforce for the very first time."
