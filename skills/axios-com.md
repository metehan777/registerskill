SpaceX is gobbling up most of the IPO headlines, but float fans needn't wait until June.

- Eight companies plan to raise at least $100 million in U.S. IPOs this week, which would be the most such activity since 2021.
- The octet's largest issuer and the one most tied to AI - Forgent Power Solutions - is expected to price tonight.
- Hair-loss biotech Verademics was first out of the gate, raising $256 million after pricing above its offering range.

The big picture: It's a diverse bunch of companies, ranging from energy to retail to biotech to digital marketing. There's even a celebrity-driven brand, with Jennifer Garner's Once Upon a Farm.

- Some of the high volume is backlog from last winter's government shutdown, during which certain companies pushed Q4 2025 listings into Q1 2026.

What to watch: Aftermarket performance.

- The IPO window is wide open, but it can slam shut quickly.
- Five of the seven U.S. IPOs to raise at least $100 million last month are trading below their IPO price, several by double-digits. There also were some aftermarket dogs in December, like Lumexa and Wealthfront.
- Renaissance Capital's IPO index not only underperforms the S&P 500 over the past year, it's actually negative . Same goes for the one-, three-, and six-month periods.
- If traders come to believe that they're likely to get a Day 2 discount, they'll stop buying on Day 1.

The bottom line: The next couple months could determine IPO activity in the back half of 2026.

#### The BFD

Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN) agreed to buy Silicon Laboratories (Nasdaq: SLAB), an Austin, Texas-based chipmaker with a particular focus on IoT, for $7.5 billion in cash.

Why it's the BFD: The semiconductor market keeps consolidating, even within the analog world.

Zoom in: TI will pay $231 per share, which represents around a 69% premium on yesterday's closing price.

- It's the company's largest acquisition since buying National Semiconductor for $6.5 billion in 2011.

The bottom line: "Because of its outsized role in global supply chains, Texas Instruments has become a barometer of sorts for much of the economy, showing whether businesses have confidence in future sales." - Nick Turner, Bloomberg

Data: [Financial Modeling Prep](https://financialmodelingprep.com/); Chart: Axios Visuals
Disney yesterday named Josh D'Amaro as its next CEO , succeeding Bob Iger.

- D'Amaro helped drive Disney's investment in Fortnite maker Epic Games, and reportedly envisions "giving videogames a bigger role at the company and integrating gaming technology throughout its creative processes."

This may mean Disney becomes a buyer in gaming M&A, despite Electronic Arts being off the board.

- One possibility would be gaining control of Epic, if it could convince Tencent to sell its stake, or maybe even making a play for Roblox if it can get past the trust and safety challenges.

An intriguing (and expensive) target floated by Stephen Totilo, my former Axios colleague who now writes Game File , could be Microsoft's Xbox division, which includes Minecraft.

- Satya Nadella emphasized gaming upon becoming CEO, but Microsoft now is much more focused on AI.
