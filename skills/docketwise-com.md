DocketWise is the fourth immigration software I've used in my career. None come close. It's everything I'd wished for in an immigration forms software. Law offices would be well-served to at least give it a try. I've already enthusiastically recommended DocketWise to several colleagues.
*Saja Raoof / Founder and Principal , Saja Raoof, Inc. Law Corporation*
This product has increased my law firms productivity ten fold. Before I used to do forms on my own from the USCIS website. Using DocketWise, has caused me to give up paper questionnaires and keeps me from inputting information directly into forms.
*Shahzad Khan / Principal Attorney, Shahzad R, Khan Legal, PLLC*
I am extremely pleased with DocketWise. This software streamlined my Immigration practice and enabled me to process more cases in less time. Clients (and my staff) love how "user friendly" this software is. Definitely a great value for the money.
