## Technical SEO & AEO for E-commerce & SaaS

I specialize in technical SEO and Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) for product-led companies. When your documentation, product pages, crawl directives, and knowledge base need to work as hard as your sales team-that's where I come in.

From VTEX e-commerce platforms to Shopify Plus stores, I've helped global brands architect their content for both traditional search engines and AI agents like ChatGPT and Gemini.

My approach combines data analysis, technical audits, and strategic content planning. Every recommendation is backed by data, refined through testing, and built to scale.

Whether it's a technical audit or a content strategy, my goal is to find the most effective solution.

Based in Lisbon, Portugal, working with e-commerce brands globally.
