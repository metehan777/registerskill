## Wrong Answers are a Business Problem.

When customers get different or incorrect answers, it hurts more than support. It increases costs, slows sales, and damages trust.

- ### Wasted support resources Your support team spends 80% of their time answering the same questions over and over again.
- ### Damaged brand reputation Inconsistent answers erode customer trust and damage your brand's reputation.
- ### Lost sales opportunities Customers who can't find the answers they need will buy from your competitors. Inconsistent answers across FAQs, chat, and support make customers lose confidence in your brand.
- ### Poor customer experience A frustrating customer experience leads to churn and negative reviews.
- ### Inaccurate business intelligence You can't make good business decisions when you don't have accurate data about what your customers are asking.
