Disclaimer #### How the math works *This information is reflected as estimates only and not a guarantee of exact caseload growth, hours reclaimed, or revenue increased. Caseload growth estimate is based on MyCase's potential caseload growth of 38%. The estimated output for hours reclaimed monthly is based on the number of clients billed monthly in addition to past due invoices, as well as the average hours spent invoicing and LawPay's estimated improved efficiency rate of 39%. It assumes the time required to create and send invoices to current and past-due clients is equivalent. Finally, 5.3 hours are added to this number based on an analysis of anonymized MyCase customer data, which found that MyCase customers who used the Smart Time Finder feature captured an additional 64 hours per year, or an average of 5.3 hours per month. The estimate for potential revenue increase is based on the same Smart Time Finder time savings figure, as well as the inputted billable rate and the estimated hours reclaimed per month. 38 % Increase your caseload by 38% on average 15,000 + Law Firms Choose MyCase 3 + Billable Hours per Day Gained ## Immigration lawyers, are you ready for the USCIS payment switch?
